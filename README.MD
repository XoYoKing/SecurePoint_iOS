SecurePoint is the most user-friendly security platform available and provides seamless connectivity to School Administration, Resource Officers, City Dispatch and other 1st Responders. 

We can setup your facility in minutes. Whatever security needs your School has, we can provide a solution immediately. Since, we are Software as a Service, you will not need to worry about providing or hosting hardware of any kind; therefore, your staff will not be required to provide any support.

With SecurePoint you can seamlessly connect to operators in your designated GeoSpatial area via chat, audio, video and push notifications. In the event of an escalated emergency you can contact your local 911 operator with the tap of a single button. We have new features for Police Officers at their request for optimal integration.

SecurePoint is an entire platform in one convenient App. End-users and Operators are differentiated by credentials. As an operator, you can now be an engaged 1st Responder.
